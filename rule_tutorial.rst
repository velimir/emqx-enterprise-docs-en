Rule Engine Tutorial
====================

.. _rule_engine_examples.dashboard.mysql:

Create MySQL Rules
------------------

0. Setup a MySQL database, and changes the username/password to root/public, taking Mac OSX for instance::

    $ brew install mysql

    $ brew services start mysql

    $ mysql -u root -h localhost -p

      ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'public';

1. Initiate MySQL table::

    $ mysql -u root -h localhost -ppublic

  create "test" database::

    CREATE DATABASE test;

  create "t_mqtt_msg" table::

    USE test;

    CREATE TABLE `t_mqtt_msg` (
    `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `msgid` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
    `topic` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    `qos` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    `payload` blob,
    `arrived` datetime NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    INDEX topic_index(`id`, `topic`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8MB4;

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_init_1.png

2. Create a rule:

  Go to `emqx dashboard <http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules>`_, select the "rule" tab on the menu to the left.

  Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL::

    SELECT * FROM "#"

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_sql_1.png

3. Bind an action:

   Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select "Data to MySQL" in the pop-up dialog window.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_action_1.png

4. Fill in the parameters required by the action:

   Two parameters is required by action "Data to MySQL":

  1). SQL template. SQL template is the sql command you'd like to run when the action is triggered. In this example we'll insert a message into mysql, so type in the following sql template::

    insert into t_mqtt_msg(msgid, topic, qos, payload, arrived) values (${id}, ${topic}, ${qos}, ${payload}, FROM_UNIXTIME(${timestamp}/1000))

  Before data is inserted into the table, placeholders like ${key} will be replaced by the corresponding values.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_action_2.png

  2). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource" is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New Resource" to the top right, and then select "MySQL":

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_action_3.png

5. Configure the resource:

  Set "MySQL Database" to "test", "MySQL Username" to "root", "MySQL Password" to "public", and "Description" to "MySQL resource to 127.0.0.1:3306 db=test", and click on the "Testing Connection" button to make sure the connection can be created successfully, and then click on the "Create" button.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_resource_1.png

6. Back to the "Actions" dialog, and then click on the "Confirm" button.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_action_4.png

7. Back to the creating rule page, then click on "Create" button. The rule we created will be show in the rule list:

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_rule_overview_1.png

8. We have finished, testing the rule by sending an MQTT message to emqx:

    Topic: "t/a"

    QoS: 1

    Payload: "hello"

  Then inspect the MySQL table, verify a new record has been inserted:

.. _rule_engine_examples.dashboard.pgsql:

Create PostgreSQL Rules
-----------------------

0. Setup a PostgreSQL database, taking Mac OSX for instance::

    $ brew install postgresql

    $ brew services start postgresql

    ## create root user
    $ createuser --interactive --pwprompt
      Enter name of role to add: root
      Enter password for new role: public
      Enter it again: public
      Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y

    ## create database named 'mqtt' using root
    $ createdb -U root mqtt

    $ psql -U root mqtt

      mqtt=> \dn;
      List of schemas
        Name  | Owner
      --------+-------
       public | shawn
      (1 row)

1. Initiate PgSQL table:

  $ psql -U root mqtt

  create ``t_mqtt_msg`` table::

    CREATE TABLE t_mqtt_msg (
    id SERIAL primary key,
    msgid character varying(64),
    sender character varying(64),
    topic character varying(255),
    qos integer,
    retain integer,
    payload text,
    arrived timestamp without time zone
    );

2. Create a rule:

  Go to `emqx dashboard <http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules>`_, select the "rule" tab on the menu to the left.

  Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL::

    SELECT * FROM "#"

  .. image:: ./_static/images/mysql_sql_1.png

3. Bind an action:

  Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select "Data to PostgreSQL" in the pop-up dialog window.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/pgsql_action_0.png

4. Fill in the parameters required by the action:

  Two parameters is required by action "Data to PostgreSQL":

  1). SQL template. SQL template is the sql command you'd like to run when the action is triggered. In this example we'll insert a message into pgsql, so type in the following sql template::

    insert into t_mqtt_msg(msgid, topic, qos, retain, payload, arrived) values (${id}, ${topic}, ${qos}, ${retain}, ${payload}, to_timestamp(${timestamp}::double precision /1000)) returning id

  Before data is inserted into the table, placeholders like ${key} will be replaced by the corresponding values.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/pgsql_action_1.png

  2). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource" is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New Resource" to the top right, and then select "PostgreSQL":

  .. image:: ./_static/images/pgsql_resource_0.png

  Select "PostgreSQL Resource".

5. Configure the resource:

  Set "PostgreSQL Database" to "mqtt", "PostgreSQL User" to "root", and keep all other configs as default, and click on the "Testing Connection" button to make sure the connection can be created successfully.

  Finally click on the "Create" button.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/pgsql_resource_1.png

6. Back to the "Actions" dialog, and then click on the "Confirm" button.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/pgsql_action_2.png

7. Back to the creating rule page, then click on "Create" button. The rule we created will be show in the rule list:

  .. image:: ./_static/images/pgsql_rule_overview_1.png

8. We have finished, testing the rule by sending an MQTT message to emqx:

    Topic: "t/1"

    QoS: 0

    Retained: false

    Payload: "hello1"

  Then inspect the PgSQL table, verify a new record has been inserted:

  .. image:: ./_static/images/pgsql_result_1.png

  And from the rule list, verify that the "Matched" column has increased to 1:

.. _rule_engine_examples.dashboard.timescaledb:

Create TimescaleDB Rules
------------------------

0. Setup a TimescaleDB database, taking Mac OSX for instance::

    $ docker pull timescale/timescaledb

    $ docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg11

    $ docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres

    ## create tutorial database
    > CREATE database tutorial;

    > \c tutorial

    > CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;

1. Initiate the TimescaleDB table::

    $ docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -d tutorial

    CREATE TABLE conditions (
      time        TIMESTAMPTZ       NOT NULL,
      location    TEXT              NOT NULL,
      temperature DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL,
      humidity    DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL
    );

    SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time');

2. Create a rule:

  Go to `emqx dashboard <http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules>`_, select the "rule" tab on the menu to the left.

  Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL::

    SELECT
      payload.temp as temp,
      payload.humidity as humidity,
      payload.location as location
    FROM
      "#"

  .. image:: ./_static/images/timescaledb_sql_1.png

3. Bind an action:

  Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select "Data to TimescaleDB" in the pop-up dialog window.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/timescaledb_action_0.png

4. Fill in the parameters required by the action:

  Two parameters is required by action "Data to TimescaleDB":

  1). SQL template. SQL template is the sql command you'd like to run when the action is triggered. In this example we'll insert a message into timescaledb, so type in the following sql template::

    insert into conditions(time, location, temperature, humidity) values (NOW(), ${location}, ${temp}, ${humidity})

  Before data is inserted into the table, placeholders like ${key} will be replaced by the corresponding values.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/timescaledb_action_1.png

  2). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource" is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New Resource" to the top right, and then select "TimescaleDB":

  .. image:: ./_static/images/timescaledb_action_1.png

5. Configure the resource:

  Set "TimescaleDB Database" to "tutorial", "TimescaleDB User" to "postgres", "TimescaleDB Password" to "password", and keep all other configs as default, and click on the "Testing Connection" button to make sure the connection can be created successfully, and then click on the "Create" button.

  .. image:: ./_static/images/timescaledb_resource_0.png

8. We have finished, testing the rule by sending an MQTT message to emqx:

    Topic: "t/1"

    QoS: 0

    Retained: false

    Payload: {"temp":24,"humidity":30,"location":"hangzhou"}

  Then inspect the TimescaleDB table, verify a new record has been inserted:

    tutorial=# SELECT * FROM conditions LIMIT 100;

  The output data could look like this::

                time              | location | temperature | humidity
    ------------------------------+----------+-------------+----------
    2019-06-27 01:41:08.752103+00 | hangzhou |          24 |       30

.. _rule_engine_examples.cli:

Create Simple Rules using CLI
-----------------------------

.. _rule_engine_examples.cli.inspect:

Create Inspect Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a rule for testing: print the content of the message and all the args of the action, when a MQTT message is sent to topic 't/a'.

- The filter SQL is: SELECT * FROM "t/a";
- The action is: "print the content of the message and all the args of the action", the action we need is 'inspect'.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ ./bin/emqx_ctl rules create \
      "SELECT * FROM \"t/a\" WHERE " \
      '[{"name":"inspect", "params": {"a": 1}}]' \
      -d 'Rule for debug'

    Rule rule:803de6db created

The CLI above created a rule with ID='Rule rule:803de6db'.

The first two args are mandatory:

- SQL: SELECT * FROM "t/a"
- Action List: [{"name":"inspect", "params": {"a": 1}}]. Action List is of tye JSON Array. "name" is the name of the action, "params" is the parameters of the action. Note that the action ``inspect`` does not need a resource.

The last arg is an optional description of the rule: 'Rule for debug'.

If a MQTT message "hello" is sent to topic 't/a', the rule "Rule rule:803de6db" will be matched, and then action "inspect" will be triggered, the following info will be printed to the emqx console::

    $ tail -f log/erlang.log.1

    (emqx@127.0.0.1)1> [inspect]
        Selected Data: #{client_id => <<"shawn">>,event => 'message.publish',

                topic => <<"t/a">>}
        Action Init Params: #{<<"a">> => 1}

- ``Selected Data`` listed the fields that selected by the SQL.All available fields will be listed here, as we used ``select *``.
- ``Envs`` is the environment varibles that can be used internally in the action.
- ``Action Init Params`` is the params we passed to the action.

Create WebHook Rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a rule: Forward all the messages that send from client_id='Steven', to the Web Server at 'http://127.0.0.1:9910':

- The filter SQL: SELECT username as u, payload FROM "#" where u='Steven';
- Actions: "Forward to 'http://127.0.0.1:9910'";
- Resource Type: web_hook;
- Resource: "The WebHook resource at 'http://127.0.0.1:9910'".

0. Create a simpile Web service using linux tool ``nc``::

    $ while true; do echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n $(date)" | nc -l 127.0.0.1 9910; done;

1. Create a resource of resource type "WebHook", and configure the url:

   1). List all available resource types, make sure 'web_hook' exists::

    $ ./bin/emqx_ctl resource-types list

    resource_type(name='web_hook', provider='emqx_web_hook', params=#{...}}, on_create={emqx_web_hook_actions,on_resource_create}, description='WebHook Resource')
    ...

   2). Create a new resource using resource type 'web_hook', configure "url"="http://127.0.0.1:9910"::

    $ ./bin/emqx_ctl resources create \
      'web_hook' \
      -c '{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:9910", "headers": {"token":"axfw34y235wrq234t4ersgw4t"}, "method": "POST"}'

    Resource resource:691c29ba created

   Above CLI created a resource with ID='resource:691c29ba', the first arg is mandatory - The resource type (web_hook). HTTP method is POST, and an HTTP Header is set: "token".

2. Create a rule, and bind action 'data_to_webserver' to it:

   1). List all available actions, make sure 'data_to_webserver' exists::

    $ ./bin/emqx_ctl rule-actions list

    action(name='data_to_webserver', app='emqx_web_hook', for='$any', types=[web_hook], params=#{'$resource' => ...}, title ='Data to Web Server', description='Forward Messages to Web Server')
    ...

   2). Create the rule, bind the action data_to_webserver, and bind resource resource:691c29ba to the action via the arg "$resource"::

    $ ./bin/emqx_ctl rules create \
     "SELECT username as u, payload FROM \"#\" where u='Steven'" \
     '[{"name":"data_to_webserver", "params": {"$resource":  "resource:691c29ba"}}]' \
     -d "Forward publish msgs from steven to webserver"

    rule:26d84768

   Above CLI is simlar to the first Inspect rule, with exception that the resource 'resource:691c29ba' is bound to 'data_to_webserver'. The binding is done by a special arg named '$resource'. What the action 'data_to_webserver' does is sending messages to the specified web server.

3. Now let's send a message "hello" to an arbitrary topic using username "Steven", this will trigger the rule we created above, and the Web Server will receive an message and return 200 OK::

    $ while true; do echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n $(date)" | nc -l 127.0.0.1 9910; done;

    POST / HTTP/1.1
    content-type: application/json
    content-length: 32
    te:
    host: 127.0.0.1:9910
    connection: keep-alive
    token: axfw34y235wrq234t4ersgw4t

    {"payload":"hello","u":"Steven"}
